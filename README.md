# noble-bls12-381

[bls12-381](https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/), a pairing-friendly elliptic curve construction.

This is a [Barreto-Lynn-Scott curve](https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/088) with an embedding degree of 12 & 128-bit security level.

It allows simple construction of threshold signatures, which allows a user to
sign 100 messages with one signature and verify them swiftly in batch.

##### `getPublicKey(privateKey)`
```typescript
function getPublicKey(privateKey: Uint8Array | string | bigint): Uint8Array;
```
- `privateKey: Uint8Array | string | bigint` will be used to generate public key.
  Public key is generated by executing scalar multiplication of a base Point(x, y) by a fixed
  integer. The result is another `Point(x, y)` which we will by default encode to hex Uint8Array.
- Returns `Uint8Array`: endcoded publicKey for signature verification

##### `sign(hash, privateKey, domain)`
```typescript
function sign(
  hash: Uint8Array | string,
  privateKey: Uint8Array | string | bigint,
  domain: Uint8Array | string | bigint
): Promise<Uint8Array>;
```
- `hash: Uint8Array | string` - message hash which would be signed
- `privateKey: Uint8Array | string | bigint` - private key which will sign the hash
- `domain: Uint8Array | string | bigint` - version of signature. Different domains will give different signatures. Setting a new domain in an upgraded system prevents it from being affected by the old messages and signatures.
- Returns encoded signature.

##### `verify(hash, publicKey, signature, domain)`
```typescript
function verify(
  hash: Uint8Array | string,
  publicKey: Uint8Array | string,
  signature: Uint8Array | string,
  domain: Uint8Array | string | bigint
): Promise<boolean>
```
- `hash: Uint8Array | string` - message hash that needs to be verified
- `publicKey: Uint8Array | string` - e.g. that was generated from `privateKey` by `getPublicKey`
- `signature: Uint8Array | string` - object returned by the `sign` or `aggregateSignatures` function
- Returns `Promise<boolean>`: `Promise<true>` if `signature == hash`; otherwise `Promise<false>`

##### `aggregatePublicKeys(publicKeys)`
```typescript
function aggregatePublicKeys(publicKeys: Uint8Array[] | string[]): Uint8Array;
```
- `publicKeys: Uint8Array[] | string[]` - e.g. that have been generated from `privateKey` by `getPublicKey`
- Returns `Uint8Array`: one aggregated public key which calculated from putted public keys

##### `aggregateSignatures(signatures)`
```typescript
function aggregateSignatures(signatures: Uint8Array[] | string[]): Uint8Array;
```
- `signatures: Uint8Array[] | string[]` - e.g. that have been generated by `sign`
- Returns `Uint8Array`: one aggregated signature which calculated from putted signatures

##### `verifyMultiple(hashes, publicKeys, signature, domain)`
```typescript
function verifyMultiple(
  hashes: Uint8Array[] | string[],
  publicKeys: Uint8Array[] | string[],
  signature: Uint8Array | string,
  domain: Uint8Array | string | bigint
): Promise<boolean>
```
- `hashes: Uint8Array[] | string[]` - messages hashes that needs to be verified
- `publicKeys: Uint8Array[] | string[]` - e.g. that were generated from `privateKeys` by `getPublicKey`
- `signature: Uint8Array | string` - object returned by the `aggregateSignatures` function
- Returns `Promise<boolean>`: `Promise<true>` if `signature == hashes`; otherwise `Promise<false>`

## Curve Description

BLS12-381 is a pairing-friendly elliptic curve construction from the [BLS family](https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/088), with embedding degree 12. It is built over a 381-bit prime field `GF(p)` with...

* z = `-0xd201000000010000`
* p = (z - 1)<sup>2</sup> ((z<sup>4</sup> - z<sup>2</sup> + 1) / 3) + z
	* = `0x1a0111ea397fe69a4b1ba7b6434bacd764774b84f38512bf6730d2a0f6b0f6241eabfffeb153ffffb9feffffffffaaab`
* q = z<sup>4</sup> - z<sup>2</sup> + 1
	* = `0x73eda753299d7d483339d80809a1d80553bda402fffe5bfeffffffff00000001`

... yielding two **source groups** G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>, each of 255-bit prime order `q`, such that an efficiently computable non-degenerate bilinear pairing function `e` exists into a third **target group** G<sub>T</sub>. Specifically, G<sub>1</sub> is the `q`-order subgroup of E(F<sub>p</sub>) : y^2 = x^3 + 4 and G<sub>2</sub> is the `q`-order subgroup of E'(F<sub>p<sup>2</sup></sub>) : y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + 4(u + 1) where the extention field F<sub>p<sup>2</sup></sub> is defined as F<sub>p</sub>(u) / (u<sup>2</sup> + 1).

BLS12-381 is chosen so that `z` has small Hamming weight (to improve pairing performance) and also so that `GF(q)` has a large 2<sup>32</sup> primitive root of unity for performing radix-2 fast Fourier transforms for efficient multi-point evaluation and interpolation. It is also chosen so that it exists in a particularly efficient and rigid subfamily of BLS12 curves.

## Security

Noble is production-ready & secure. Our goal is to have it audited by a good security expert.

We're using built-in JS `BigInt`, which is "unsuitable for use in cryptography" as [per official spec](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint#cryptography). This means that the lib is vulnerable to [timing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack). But:

1. JIT-compiler and Garbage Collector make "constant time" extremely hard to achieve in a scripting language.
2. Which means *any other JS library doesn't use constant-time bigints*. Including bn.js or anything else. Even statically typed Rust, a language without GC, [makes it harder to achieve constant-time](https://www.chosenplaintext.ca/open-source/rust-timing-shield/security) for some cases.
3. Overall they are quite rare; for our particular usage they're unimportant. If your goal is absolute security, don't use any JS lib ‚Äî including bindings to native ones. Try LibreSSL & similar low-level libraries & languages.
4. We however consider infrastructure attacks like rogue NPM modules very important; that's why it's crucial to minimize the amount of 3rd-party dependencies & native bindings. If your app uses 500 dependencies, any dep could get hacked and you'll be downloading rootkits with every `npm install`. Our goal is to minimize this attack vector.
